# Updated_Portofolio

## Description
My updated portfolio includes links to my `GitHub` & `LinkedIn` profile page, as well as my resume. Additionally, I have included a list of projects, which can be found <a href="https://tronciu92.github.io/Updated_Portofolio/#projects-div">here</a>. For each project I have included a link to a deployed version and to my GitHub repository.

## Design
The portfolio will look like the images below:
